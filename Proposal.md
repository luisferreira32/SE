[Project overview]  
The project consists of an web app to see, vote and comment on dog pictures. It will be developed mainly using python (django) with a user authentication system for uploading images, voting and commenting.
It will be separated in a couple views: "index" view where the posts are listed and ordered by upvotes; a "detail" view where we can see the picture and comment; and user related views where we can log in, edit profile and upload posts.

---

[System architecture]  
It's a simple web app with a database and an image storage.

[Database tables]  

First we propose to use an extension of the class, and therefore the database table, of an already existing django class, from django.contrib.auth, that will help with authentication. The other tables are from original model classes.  
It is to note that comment table primary key is only complete with the post foreign key.
