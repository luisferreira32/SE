[Project overview]  
The project consists of an web app to see, vote and comment on dog pictures. It will be developed mainly using python (django) with a user authentication system for uploading images, voting and commenting.
It will be separated in a couple views: "index" view where the posts are listed and ordered by upvotes; a "detail" view where we can see the picture and comment; a "user" view where we can see and edit our profile, and post new cute dog pictures; and a "login" view where the user logs in to the page.
